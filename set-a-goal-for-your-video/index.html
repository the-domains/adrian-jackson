<p>Most business owners know the value of video. There are plenty of websites out there that will tell you how video can improve customer engagement, boost traffic and ultimately drive sales. The problem most business owners have is they don’t know where to begin and when they do, they find video too expensive.</p><p>In an oversimplified nutshell, both these problems stem from the creation of video for the sake of creating video. If the video is the end goal, then it is almost impossible for the video not to be too expensive. On the other hand, with the right objectives and forward planning, you can experience great results from your video.</p><p>In this post I want to help you determine what those objectives are and ensure you are ready to create an amazing video that brings you a great return on investment.</p><h2>Set a goal for your video</h2><p>The first consideration in creating a video is to know what purpose the video will play in your business. Is the video helping with brand awareness, product promotion or helping to close sales? Is there a way you can quantify what the success of this video would mean for your business? The reality is that video is an expensive medium. Be sure that you will get your value from your investment before you decide to pull the trigger.</p><p>Set a SMART goal to define what you hope your video will achieve. Some examples of a goal for your video might be:</p><ul><li>Encourage 15 people to sign up for the coaching workshop in the next 30 days</li><li>Increase the sales of dolls by 75% in July to September</li><li>Boost positive brand association in men aged 25-45 by 30% in 2 months</li></ul><p>Don’t forget that the R in SMART is for Realistic. Will you actually be able to achieve that goal? It is also helpful to determine what other factors could influence your success in achieving the goal. For example, a great video might inspire a ton of sign ups for your workshop but if the signup form is broken, your results will fall short of expectations.</p><p>A well defined goal will help you know why you are spending money on the video, provide direction for the creation of the video and enable you to measure its success after the fact.</p><h2>Choose an audience for your video</h2><p>You may have defined your audience as part of your goal setting. If you haven’t, defining the intended audience for your video will help you achieve success with your video investment.</p><p>A lot of people like to set very broad audiences. While this is easy it’s a bit like the saying “jack of all trades, master of none”. A video created without a clear audience won’t resonate particularly well with anybody. A great video makes you feel like you are the only person watching - as if the video is speaking to you alone. To do this successfully you need to create a profile of the ideal prospect or customer that will represent your audience.</p><p>An effective profile will contain everything you’d expect to find on someone’s Facebook profile: name, age, gender, family, job and interests. Its also good to know what types of messages this person responds to. Do they buy easily? Have you seen any trends in the past?</p><h2>Decide on a clear message and action</h2><p>Try to avoid cramming too much into one video. Instead, choose one clear message and action you want your audience to leave with.</p><p>The best messages are one liners. While it may take a bit of storytelling to convey that message, at the end of the story, a simple message will be remembered best. When people hear a clear message, they will be more inclined to respond to a clear call to action.</p><p>Try to avoid giving people a choice between responses at the end of the video. A video only allows you a brief moment to encourage a decision. Avoid overwhelming your viewer with multiple choices. If you give them multiple options, doing nothing may seem easier. Instead give them one possible action, the choice will be to do something or do nothing.</p><h2>Start considering a distribution plan</h2><p>A great video will provide you with little value if nobody ever watches it. Unfortunately, videos don’t just go viral - most viral campaigns are a result of painstakingly careful strategy and planning. You will have the most success in getting responses to your video if you plan a distribution strategy from the start.</p><p>Knowing where you plan to distribute your content will likely affect how your content is presented. For example, if you are distributing your videos using Facebook’s native video, it is likely your video will be watched on mobile devices. Content for mobile devices will work best when it can be viewed without sound (often people browse Facebook on public transport or other public places and don’t have their headphones on).</p><p>Distribution choices will also impact the ideal duration of your content and what call to action will work best. A video played as part of a presentation at a conference be longer as you have a captive audience. Inviting people to visit your stand in the foyer will also work a lot better at a conference than it will on a Facebook video.</p><h2>Decide on a budget</h2><p>You are now in a great position to decide on a budget. Setting a budget for your video is important because expenses in video production can definitely be attributed to Parkinson’s Law or the question, “how long is a piece of string?” A 30 second video might cost a few hundred dollars or hundreds of thousands of dollars.</p><p>By setting a budget, you are giving the production team a parameter in which to balance time and equipment expenses. It is important to note that smaller budgets will affect the production quality and if your brand requires higher quality, be willing to pay more for that. That said, the most important factor in any video production budget should always be the value the video will bring to your business.</p><p>The best way to set a budget for your video is to quantify the impact of the goal for your video. For example, if you were to increase sales by 75% in the next quarter, that could mean an increase in revenue of $23000. Supposing you were prepared to invest 30% into marketing, that would give you a budget of $6900. After expenses such as web design and advertising, that might leave with you a budget of $4000 to spend on production.</p><h2>What next?</h2><p>You now have the information ready to take to your video producer. These questions will help you decide if your video producer is a good fit for you and help you know whether your spend is worthwhile to your business.</p><p>Are there any other factors which influence how a video will help your business that I’ve missed?
